# About

A barebones app for (eventually) generating a warband for Five Leagues from the Borderlands

# Development

initial commit - app generates a single random character when run, and applies any racial bonuses to the character


### Serving Your App

Run the following command from the warband_gui folder to run the app with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
